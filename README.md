# assignment_secrets
Build a web app that allows users to store and share their darkest secrets.

## Maddie Rajavasireddy

### Assignment Description:    
Build an app that allows programmers to share glimpses into their non-coding lives. These glimpses will be short snippets of text which will be hidden from other users by default. Programmers will have to request permission to view each other's secrets. If the receiver of the request is feeling trusting enough—perhaps they forewent a night's drone building and are thus better rested and less paranoid than usual—they can accept the request, allowing their code compatriot to view the contents the secret.

### Packages used:    
bcrypt, md5, cookie sessions, express, handlebars, moment, mongoose and morgan
